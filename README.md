## Introduction

### EDIT:
Hey! soo, it is 2026 now, I am done with Django, stopped till Redis and Celery, and a few other packages. Checking out React Native and flutter for now.

Hello, I am a student pursuing a **Bachelor's degree** in **Computer Science**, exploring new technologies, recently started exploiting the free Github Student Developer Pack. 😊

<s>Currently working on a django project, it is live on a temperory domain <a href="https://cityhub-gyg8d5gcdygdgyg4.centralindia-01.azurewebsites.net/">Cityhub</a>. Its' a **Work In Progress** so you will see some drastic changes shortly. The repository is currently **private** because the database is still just a `db.sqlite3` file which would be publicly accessible if shared 💀. I am in the process of learning how to securely migrate the database to an external server.</s>

EDIT: I lost motivation for that project and it is no longer live, it is also public now. Btw I did finished understanding DB management in my other projects.

<s>For the mean time, feel free to use some C libraries in my [Library](https://github.com/Lakshya717/Library) repo.</s>

**EDIT:** will come back to it when I will continue DSA for the interviews
