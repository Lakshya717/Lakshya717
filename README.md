## Introduction

I am a student pursuing a **Bachelor's degree** in **Computer Science**, exploring new technologies, recently started exploiting the free Github Student Developer Pack ðŸ˜Š ( that's why you can see the Pro badge on my account )

Currently working on a django project, it is live on a temperory domain <a href="https://cityhub-gyg8d5gcdygdgyg4.centralindia-01.azurewebsites.net/">Cityhub</a>. Its' a **Work In Progress** so you will see some drastic changes shortly. The repository is currently **private** because the database is still just a `db.sqlite3` file which would be publicly accessible if shared ðŸ’€. I am in the process of learning how to securely migrate the database to an external server.

For the mean time, feel free to use some C libraries in my [Library](https://github.com/Lakshya717/Library) repo.
